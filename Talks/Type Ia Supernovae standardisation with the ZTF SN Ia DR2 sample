Hubble Diagram
Light curve - fitting to the flux curve, parameters are amplitude, stretch and colour
Can also look at the spectrum 
Have to remove the scatter from the data to make it cosmological valuable
Colour standardisation, then stretch and then the environmental consideration can help collapse the data from scattered to simple
Geometry goes from 0 to 10^-3 redshift, then any standard candle above than up to 10^-2, but for redshift 1 f.ex. need Ia SNe
ZTF - Zwicky Transient Facility
2628 SNe usable for cosmology, 3628 overall
