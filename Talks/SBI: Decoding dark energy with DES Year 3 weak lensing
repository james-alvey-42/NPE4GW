Questions in astrophysics and cosmology - S8, H0, Lambda etc.
Precision and accuracy improvements from SBI
Lambda CDM  - omega matter, structure formation (S8) - wCDM - w = DE eos
Data x, Model M --> p(theta|x,M), theta model parameters, p(M1|x) vs p(M0|X)
Evidence networks
P(theta|x,M) prop to p(x|theta,M) * p(theta|M)
SBI useful when likelihood unknown or intractable - likelihood free inference, draw x_i from distribution p(x|theta_i) by running simulations
SBI in astrophysics - 1. simulate mock data, 2. compress mock data 3. run results and do inference
Accuracy - realistic forward modelling, SBI; Precision - beyond standard statistics
Gower St Simulations - other parameters is like noise in the forward model, identical to marginalizing - massively reduces dimension of the data
Compress the maps down using CNNs to get simples summary statistics
Variational Mutual Information Maximization is formally optimal
Data cuts
Extremely fast to reevaluate once likelihood is learnt
Expected coverage tests - good way of testing to see if the posterior is correct
