Analytic likelihood functions, not simulation based inference
Train neural network emulators to put in inference loops
Accuracy usually done with RMSE, rule of thumb followed for RMSE average value, usually 0.1sigma
What we are actually interested in is recovery of the posterior if we use an emulator rather than the full simulation
Comparing recovered posteriors with ARES code and then the emulator with ARES
Emulator bias - difference in means between global emulator and ARES; true bias is difference in means between ARES and true value
Even with 0.05sigma RMSE, can't accurately recover posterior with globalemu
Kullback-Leibler Divergence- assume model is linear, linear emulator error, gaussian likelihood etc.
