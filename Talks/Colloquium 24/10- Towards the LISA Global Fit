Millihertz GW
3 spacecraft, 1 au heliocentric orbits, construction begins next year, launch expected 2035
LIGO - Michelson interferometer
LISA - fire lasers at each other, time-delay interferometry
Not just long wavelength - need a more complicated formula, becomes integral
Double white dwarfs - most numerous sources
Confusion noise foreground - either signal of galactic DWD population, or noise over GW waves
Supermassive BHs - short transient blips, very loud
Multiband BHs - stellar mass BHs, LISA sees early inspiral
Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals - most challenging from a data analysis perspective

Global Fit - all signals, all noises and glitches, in a single Bayesian inference
Blocked Gibbs Sampling - type of MCMC - keep most parameters fixed while the others are updated - divide and conquer approach
