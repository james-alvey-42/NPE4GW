Deterministic signals and stochastic GW backgrounds 
Deterministic - localized in the sky, time coherency, typically from binaries
Stochastic - superposition of many signals, early universe processes, diffuse
LISA measure - H0, modified gravity and stochastic GW backgrounds
Laser frequency noise is huge and needs to be suppressed with time delay interferometry
LISA response function - isotropic and non-chiral spectrum
Traditional methods quite efficient, guaranteed to converge but scale poorly with no. parameters, require explicit likelihoods
Non stationary noise - cut data into shorter segments where stationarity holds, train a network to analyze segment-by-segment, and then combine segments assuming each one is an independent draw
