        Aspect								   NPE										TMNRE
Estimation Type						       Direct posterior estimation						Likelihood-to-prior ratio estimation
Efficiency					Less efficient in high dimensions, requires full posterior			More efficient due to truncation, focused simulation
Learning Approach						  Single-step training							Multi-round, iterative refinement
Amortization						Fully amortized inference for any new data				   Not fully amortized, specific to observation
Flexibility						  General-purpose posterior estimation					Targeted marginal or parameter-specific posteriors
Simulation Efficiency		                      Can be inefficient with large parameter spaces				    More simulation-efficient due to truncation
Applicability					  Best for amortized inference across many observations			      Best for high-dimensional or targeted parameter inference
